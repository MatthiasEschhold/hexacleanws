# Training Description

Please follow the package, class, and method names as described in the exercises.

## The Branch Concept for The Labs

### Lab-Branches for Coding Challenges

---
_A codebase for each lab to implement the exercises._

The exercises build on each other. You always have a fresh sample solution
in lab branch.

**Branch name pattern:** _feature/lab{labNumber}_


### Solution-Branches for Comparison and Consolidation

---
_A possible solution for each lab._

For each exercise there is a sample solution for comparison and consolidation. 
Of course, there is not one possible solution. The tests, especially the architecture 
tests, help to ensure conformance to the clean architecture pattern.

**Branch name pattern:** _solution/lab{labNumber}_

### Main-Branch for Lab Description

See [lab description online]() under ... or publish it local like described [here](./mkdocs.md) based
on the main branch.

## Unit and Architecture Tests

The demo projects contains architecture tests and unit tests to verify your implementation.
For the most tasks it is neccessary to uncomment unit tests, after implementing the task. 
In some cases it is possible to fix or to add import statements within the unit tests.
